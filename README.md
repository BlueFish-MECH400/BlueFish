# BlueFish -DRC-101B 
Seafloor Imaging Towfish Project Brief 

## Background & Value Proposition 

Blue Robotics specializes in designing and manufacturing underwater robotic components and vehicles. Their mission is to enable to the future of underwater exploration by providing high-performance marine robotics components at an accessible price. 

The BlueBoat is a one-man-portable Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) manufactured as a kit by Blue Robotics. Due to its accessibility and low cost, the BlueBoat is intended to provide exciting opportunities to scientific researchers for large-scale data collection. One of its intended uses is for the collection of seafloor imaging of the seabed, enabled by a seafloor imaging towfish. 

Mounting a camera to a towfish, rather than a surface vessel, can result in higher resolution and quality imaging. This is due to the increased stability of the towfish, which is not affected by wave action on the surface. A towfish also enables varying degrees of resolution of imaging if the altitude or depth is controlled. Thus, by using a transducer, the towfish can maintain a constant distance above the seafloor. 

## Scope & Deliverables 

The project scope will encompass the design, build, and testing of a seafloor imaging towfish, integrated with a BlueBoat by Blue Robotics. This also includes the seafloor image data collection and presentation. 

The goal of the project is to enable the BlueBoat to collect clear seafloor images using the towfish across the range of sea-states that the BlueBoat can handle. A secondary goal is that the depth of the towfish can be controlled to increase the range of depths that the towfish can effectively image using control surfaces (if deemed necessary) and a Ping sonar transducer (single beam echosounder). The final deliverables of this project, in addition to the minimal final deliverables, will optimally be the following: 

* Produce a full, high-resolution image mosaic of the seabed, produced by the towfish, towed by the BlueBoat. 
* A fully functional and seaworthy physical prototype of the towfish.  
* Produce an image mosaic of a specified area (TBD) of the seabed outside of Sidney, BC, Canada. 
* A retail pricing analysis to prove the retail cost requirements are being met.  

The final deliverables of this project will minimally be the following: 

* A physical prototype of the towfish, which acts as a proof of concept. It may be a proof of concept of something that can maintain stability/depth that one would theoretically mount a high-resolution camera to. 
* Solidworks CAD files and related engineering calculations. 
* A completed bill of materials. 

# Use

This project is still a work in progress with lots of room for improvement. Live plotting is yet to be fully integrated into the GUI and many things need cleaning up. Additionally, the camera functionality likely needs to be completely revamped.

When using on a pi, the user needs only to run BlueCommand_main.py for operation (found in Sandbox -> GUI). Ardunino_Rev2 is the firmware for the arduino. The most up to date branch is the MVP branch and this repository really needs a clean. Apologies if I don't get around to it anytime super soon.
